# MaizePlay
> Ann Arbor's Pickup Sports Community

## Our Philosophy
MaizePlay aims to help connect people with similar sports interests that do not necessarily know when or where they will find their next game. Socializing through sports is a huge part of college experience. We want to help individuals find others that share their athletic interests, building lasting friendships and healthier routines. Finding great friends while burning calories? Sounds better than any Black Friday deal --- ofcourse! :tada:
